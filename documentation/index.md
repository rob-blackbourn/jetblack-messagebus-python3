# Overview

This is a Python 3.7+ client for the [jetblack-messagebus](https://github.com/rob-blackbourn/jetblack-messagebus).

It follows the publish-subscribe pattern, and includes support for "notification" of
a subscription by another client. This allows it to provide data on-demand.

See the server documentation for more detailed information.
